Just as the name implies, this script will add auto-complete functionality for email addresses in vim. This is very handy for those who use vim with mutt. Enjoy.

For those of you who would rather just look at the code through your browser:

Thanks to Luc Hermitte for writing a much more advanced autocomplete script [ vimscript #46 ] which helped me create this one.
